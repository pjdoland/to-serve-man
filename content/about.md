# About This Cookbook

This is a personal cookbook built with [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/), a markup language for recipes that makes it easy to store recipes as plain text files.

## Why Cooklang?

- **Version Control**: Store recipes in git and track changes over time
- **Plain Text**: No proprietary formats, just simple text files
- **Portable**: Take your recipes anywhere, open in any text editor
- **Searchable**: Easy to grep, search, and organize
- **Future-Proof**: Plain text will always be readable

## The Name

"To Serve Man" is a reference to the classic 1962 *Twilight Zone* episode of the same name. Spoiler alert: it's a cookbook.

## Technical Details

This cookbook system generates both a static website (using Jinja2 templates) and a beautifully typeset PDF (using LaTeX). It's designed to be elegant, minimal, and focused on the recipes themselves.

Built with Python, Jinja2, and LaTeX.
