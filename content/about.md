<h1>About This Cookbook</h1>

<p>This is a personal cookbook built with <a href="https://cooklang.org/">Cooklang</a>, a markup language for recipes that makes it easy to store recipes as plain text files.</p>

<h2>Why Cooklang?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Store recipes in git and track changes over time</li>
<li><strong>Plain Text</strong>: No proprietary formats, just simple text files</li>
<li><strong>Portable</strong>: Take your recipes anywhere, open in any text editor</li>
<li><strong>Searchable</strong>: Easy to grep, search, and organize</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proof</strong>: Plain text will always be readable</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Name</h2>

<p>"To Serve Man" is a reference to the classic 1962 <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode of the same name. Spoiler alert: it's a cookbook.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<p>This cookbook system generates both a static website (using Jinja2 templates) and a beautifully typeset PDF (using LaTeX). It's designed to be elegant, minimal, and focused on the recipes themselves.</p>

<p>Built with Python, Jinja2, and LaTeX.</p>
