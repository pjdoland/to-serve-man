            <p>
                <strong>To Serve Man</strong> is a personal cookbook system built using
                <a href="https://cooklang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooklang</a>,
                a markup language for recipes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recipes are stored as plain text files with the <code>.cook</code> extension,
                making them portable, version-controllable, and future-proof.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

            <p>
                This cookbook embraces elegant minimalism. Every design decision serves
                readability and beauty. Generous whitespace, refined typography, and
                a limited color palette let the recipes speak for themselves.
            </p>

            <h2>The Name</h2>

            <p>
                <em>"To Serve Man"</em> references the classic Twilight Zone episode of the same name,
                where the ominous twist reveals that an alien book titled "To Serve Man" is, in fact,
                a cookbook. Here, we embrace the pun with affection—it is indeed a cookbook,
                and a delicious one at that.
            </p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>

            <p>
                This site is generated from Cooklang recipe files using Python, Jinja2 templates,
                and is hosted on GitHub Pages. The PDF cookbook is typeset with LaTeX.
